			<h1>Customizable Topics</h1>
      	</div>
       <p>On Google News we offer links to several articles on every story, so you can first decide what subject interests you and then select which publishers’ accounts of each story you’d like to read. Click on the headline that interests you and you'll go directly to the site which published that story. </p>
       <p>
       Our articles are selected and ranked by computers that evaluate, among other things, how often and on what sites a story appears online. We also rank based on certain characteristics of news content such as freshness, location, relevance and diversity. As a result, stories are sorted without regard to political viewpoint or ideology and you can choose from a wide variety of perspectives on any given story.</p>
       <p>
        We'll continue to improve Google News by adding sources, fine-tuning our technology and providing Google News to readers in even more regions.
       </p>
       <div class ="extrapad"></div>
       <div class="page-header" id ="location">
       		<h1>Location-based News</h1>
       	</div>
       	<h3>Suggesting local news for you</h3>
       <p>When browsing Google News, we will automatically suggest a News near you section based on your location. You can see this local content in a special section for your city. Occasionally, we may not correctly identify your location. In this case you can choose to manually change your location by clicking Change Location where it appears next to the name of the city our system has automatically detected. </p>
       <p>
       When you enter your location information you should try to be as specific as possible. You may want to try entering your city's postal code. If your postal code fails to bring up accurate local content use your city and state/province. Additionally, we use automatic signals to determine which edition of Google News to show you. You may want to review how to switch editions if we're displaying news from the wrong country or in the wrong language.
       </p>
       <p>
       Due to various differences in naming conventions between countries, we may sometimes have trouble identifying your correct location. Additionally, some regions have fewer news sources and there may not be enough content to fill an entire section. We're aware of these issues and working hard to correct them.
       
       </p>
       <div class ="extrapad"></div>
       <div class="page-header" id ="google+">
       		<h1>Google+ Integration</h1>

       <p>Sometimes, the best, most relevant content for you about a particular news story may come from people you know. If you're signed in, you may see content and commentary from people in your Google+ circles alongside the day's top headlines.</p>
       
       <p>
       Just like the articles included in Google News, posts are identified and displayed by a computer algorithm that crawls Google+ for timely and interesting content. Alongside the day's top headlines, you'll be able to see content and commentary from leading newsmakers as well as people in your Google+ circles.      
        </p>

This content may include long-form narrative articles, slideshows, interactive graphics, or video stories. The links you see in Editors’ Picks are hand-picked by the news organization whose logo is displayed above the links.

You can either browse through the full collection of newspapers scanned or use Advanced News Search to specify the date range in which you'd like to search the archives.Using the News Archive Viewer, you can browse through our scanned collection like you would a physical paper, but with a searchable collection you can find countless articles on topics you care about.
